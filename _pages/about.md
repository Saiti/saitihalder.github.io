Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Amlan Sinha, an aerospace engineering doctoral candidate at Princeton University, where my focus is on revolutionizing how we navigate the cosmos. My research combines dynamical systems theory, optimal control methods, and nonlinear optimization techniques to further humanity's greatest adventure: space exploration. Whether it's charting more efficient paths for spacecrafts or diving into the intricacies of multibody cislunar dynamics, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in space mission design.

About Me
======
My story begins in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I grew up dreaming of pushing the boundaries of science and engineering ([Curious about my journey so far?](/my-journey.html)). A transformative opportunity came when I was fortunate to receive a full-ride scholarship to study at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) - a chance that would shape my future in ways I couldn't imagine. During my college years, I dove deep into mechanical engineering, laying the groundwork for my current path. Today, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), where I'm turning those childhood dreams into reality. Outside my academic pursuits, I'm 
actively involved with various ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) initiatives in various capacities, 
striving to make a positive impact within my community and beyond. After all, the best innovations come when diverse perspectives meet at the intersection of science and social impact.

Research Focus
======
Low-thrust (LT) propulsion systems are becoming increasingly popular in space missions, both large strategic science missions (e.g., Hayabusa, Dawn, Hayabusa2, Bepi-Colombo, Lucy, Psyche) and small technology demonstration missions (e.g., Mars Cube One, NEA Scout, Lunar Flashlight), due to their characteristically high specific impulses which allow them to achieve a higher payload-to-propellant ratio than their impulsive counterparts. However, such LT missions are often susceptible to safe mode events, which occurs if an anomalous event (e.g., impact with space debris) forces the spacecraft to depart from its nominal operating conditions causing it to enter a protective mode during which all thruster operations are switched off - if such a safe mode event coincides with a scheduled thrust arc, it results in what is known as a missed thrust event (MTE). Due to their characteristically long thrust arcs, MTEs are quite common for LT trajectories. And, unless specifically accounted for during the preliminary mission design phase, MTEs can severely impact the mission performance, and in some cases may even result in complete mission failure depending on the remaining mission time, and the available onboard fuel. These effects can be especially dire in missions where success depends on certain maneuvers being performed at critical junctures along the trajectory (e.g., flybys).

My research spans three main thrusts:
1. **Dynamical Structures**: Investigating how natural dynamical structures (e.g., invariant manifolds in three-body problems) can be exploited to design inherently robust trajectories,
2. **Algorithmic Enhancements**: Developing more efficient computational approaches for robust trajectory optimization through better initial guess generation, analytic derivatives computation, and parallel computation strategies for rapid solution prototyping,
3. **Theoretical Foundations**: Incorporating bi-level optimal control framework to provide formal guarantees for robust trajectory design, bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical implementation using the inherent hierarchical structure.

**Invitation to Explore**

I invite you to explore my site further to learn about my research projects, publications, and teaching endeavors. Whether you're a student interested in the field of astrodynamics, a fellow researcher, or someone passionate about the future of space exploration, I look forward to sharing insights and engaging in meaningful discussions.

Thank you for visiting, and let's embark on this journey to the stars together.
