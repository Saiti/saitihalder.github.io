Welcome to the academic website of [Amlan Sinha](https://amlan-sinha.github.io), a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University. Amlan specializes in the fields of dynamical systems, optimal control, and optimization, dedicating his research to advancing our understanding and capabilities in space mission design.

About Me
======
I am an aerospace engineering Ph.D. candidate at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), specializing in robust spacecraft trajectory design under operational uncertainties in multibody gravitational environments. Prior to this, I got my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I was born and grew up in Dhaka, Bangladesh ([See a map of my journey so far!](/my-journey.html)). Outside my academic pursuits, I'm actively involved with various ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) initiatives in various capacities, striving to make a positive impact within my community and beyond.

Research Focus
======
Optimization of robust low-thrust (LT) trajectories is inherently more challenging than the traditional single-point deterministic solutions due to their infinite-dimensional nature. Thus far, solution approaches have favored the formulation of computationally tractable methods at the sacrifice of theoretical guarantees, often relying on heuristic margin allocation techniques, rather than using the optimal control paradigm. The state-of-the-art in robust LT trajectory design involves a reformulation into a single-level finite-dimensional nonlinear program with important uncertainty parameters (e.g., missed thrust duration) chosen a priori, which sidesteps a general theory from which better insights may be derived. Bilevel optimization, and bilevel optimal control (BOC) in particular, presents a promising mathematical framework from which to improve the theory and algorithms for solving the robust LT problem. We plan to leverage BOC to accommodate an asynchronous framework that allows for parallelization, adaptability, and extensibility. However, existing literature in this area mostly focuses on multi-level parameter optimization problems, which necessitates theoretical and algorithmic development for addressing the continuous-time problems inherent in trajectory optimization. 

My primary objectives are to develop:
1. A theoretical framework for robust LT mission design with an aim towards formal performance guarantees against a-priori unknown operational uncertainties (e.g., missed thrust events (MTEs))
2. An efficient computational pipeline leveraging the hierarchical structure inherent within the BOC framework for rapid prototyping of robust LT trajectories during the preliminary mission design phase
3. Application to a series of capstone problems in complex multibody cislunar dynamics.
